# AtherysVersioning
The versioning guide for all A'therys plugins. 

## Summary

Given a version number `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, increment the:

- `MAJOR` version when you make incompatible API changes,
- `MINOR` version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
- `PATCH` version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format.
